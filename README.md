## Keep Your Fork Up To Date

You can keep your fork, and thus your private PythonAnywhere instance up to date, with the upstream using GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork">Sync Fork button</a>! After doing so, log back into your PythonAnywhere account and open a new console to pull in the changes.

## Note

This wasn't a completely original idea. This was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/novatorem/novatorem">novatorem's project</a> that was supposed to be for me only. Since others have asked for the source code, I decided to make this a public repo. I also incorporated the latest two PR's from the orignal project into this one and made it easy to customize!
