## Keep Your Fork Up To Date

You can keep your fork, and thus your private PythonAnywhere instance up to date, with the upstream using GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork">Sync Fork button</a>! After doing so, log back into your PythonAnywhere account and open a new console to pull in the changes.
